*jump.txt*	Plugin for jumping into source code

This plugin enables a documenter/developer to write a text file describing an
aspect of a program and include "links" to the spots in the source code in a
robust way.  The method of creating robust links was inspired by ctags.  It
uses an ex command that search through a file for a point in the code rather
than relying on line numbers (that change often).

This plugin automates creating a "link" or a "jump line" and jumping when the
cursor is on a jump line.

						*jump-mappings*
The following mappings are suggested:

Opens a jump line

    nmap <leader>gj <Plug>Jump

Enables saving locations in files in registers

nnoremap <leader>mz :call GetMark('z')<cr>
nnoremap <leader>mx :call GetMark('x')<cr>
nnoremap <leader>mc :call GetMark('c')<cr>
nnoremap <leader>mv :call GetMark('v')<cr>
